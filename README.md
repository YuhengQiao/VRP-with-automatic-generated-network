This code is based on python. It is used to solve the activity based vrp problem and generate the dummy pick up and dropoff links automoaticlly.
The network contains 6 nodes, 10 passengers, and 10 vehicles.

Before running the code vrp_generate_network.py, you need to unzip the Archive and replace the files sharing the same names.
